Dummy Repo to handle some api such as 1)register student
2) register course
3) cancel course
4) jwt
--> it uses mvc model utilizing the thymeleaf as a view
- authenatication made using spring security with basic authentication
- jwt code configuration written but not used to authenticate just expose the /signin api to generate token and refresh token.
- used redis cache for getAllCourses Api as a test sample for redis (didn't use Redis Template).
